<p>A library for embedding Carabiner into a Java project.</p>

<p>Overview and installation instructions are found on the <a href="https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/lib-carabiner"
                                                              target="_blank">Project page</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>
    The package {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner} provides a {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Runner} singleton
    for creating and running a native binary of the Carabiner project that is compatible with the current execution
    environment, if possible. You can call {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Runner#canRunCarabiner()} to check for
    that compatibility, and then {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Runner#start()} to extract and run it. See
    the full class documentation for more options and details.
