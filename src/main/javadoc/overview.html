<p>A library for embedding Carabiner into a Java project.</p>

<p>Overview and installation instructions are found on the <a href="https://github.com/Deep-Symmetry/lib-carabiner"
                                                              target="_blank">Project page</a> on GitHub.</p>

<p>
    The package {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner} provides a {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Runner} singleton
    for creating and running a native binary of the Carabiner project that is compatible with the current execution
    environment, if possible. You can call {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Runner#canRunCarabiner()} to check for
    that compatibility, and then {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Runner#start()} to extract and run it. See
    the full class documentation for more options and details.
</p>

<p>
    The package also offers a {@link org.deepsymmetry.libcarabiner.Message} class which can be instantiated
    using the text of any response line sent by Carabiner, and offers convenient Java access to the parsed
    content of the message (in the form of a {@link java.lang.String} message type, and a {@link java.util.Map} holding
    any detailed payload that was present.
