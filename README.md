## Installing

lib-carabiner is available through Maven Central, so to use it in your
Maven project, all you need is to include the appropriate dependency.

[![Maven Central](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/lib-carabiner/badge.svg)](https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.deepsymmetry/lib-carabiner)

Click the **maven central** badge above to view the repository entry
for beat-link. The proper format for including the latest release as a
dependency in a variety of tools, including Leiningen if you are using
beat-link from Clojure, can be found in the **Dependency Information**
section.

lib-carabiner uses [slf4j](http://www.slf4j.org/manual.html) to allow
you to integrate it with whatever Java logging framework your project
is using, so you will need to include the appropriate slf4j binding on
your class path.

It also uses [edn-java](https://github.com/bpsm/edn-java#edn-java) to
parse and build the Extensible Data Notation format messages used by
Carabiner.

## Usage

See the [API Documentation](http://deepsymmetry.org/lib-carabiner/apidocs/)
